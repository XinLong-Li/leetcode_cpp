# What is this repository about?
This repository is a collection of my practice code in `C` and `C++`.
It will include basic language features practice and also some algorithm practice.

# Compiler
I will use `gcc` for `C` and `g++` for `C++`. 
I will use `make` to manage the compilation process. So this repository will also be a playground for `make`.


## Run cpp with gcc and terminal
### Compile
`g++ -o main main.cpp`

### Run
`./main`
