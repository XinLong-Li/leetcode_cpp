### Definitions and Relationships:

1. **Full Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree in which every node has either 0 or 2 children.
   - No node has only one child.

2. **Complete Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree in which all levels are fully filled except possibly the last level.
   - The last level has all nodes as left as possible.

3. **Perfect Binary Tree**:
   - A binary tree in which all internal nodes have exactly two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
   - All levels are fully filled.

### Relationships:
- **Perfect Binary Tree** is a special case of both **Full Binary Tree** and **Complete Binary Tree**.
  - Every perfect binary tree is both full and complete.
- **Full Binary Tree** is not necessarily complete.
  - Example: A tree where all nodes have 0 or 2 children but the last level is not filled from left to right.
- **Complete Binary Tree** is not necessarily full.
  - Example: A tree where the last level is filled from left to right but some nodes have only one child.

### Visual Examples:

     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7
```

### Summary:
- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has 0 or 2 children.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: All internal nodes have 2 children, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.

Sure, here is a hierarchical relationship among full binary tree, complete binary tree, and perfect binary tree:

### Belonging Relationship:

1. **Perfect Binary Tree**:
   - A perfect binary tree is a special case of both a full binary tree and a complete binary tree.
   - Every perfect binary tree is both full and complete.

2. **Full Binary Tree**:
   - A full binary tree is not necessarily a perfect binary tree.
   - A full binary tree is not necessarily a complete binary tree.

3. **Complete Binary Tree**:
   - A complete binary tree is not necessarily a perfect binary tree.
   - A complete binary tree is not necessarily a full binary tree.

### Explanation:
- **Perfect Binary Tree**: All levels are fully filled, and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
- **Full Binary Tree**: Every node has either 0 or 2 children.
- **Complete Binary Tree**: All levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.

### Example Trees:

       / \
      2   3
     / \ / \
    4  5 6  7

#### Full Binary Tree (not perfect):
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5

#### Complete Binary Tree (not perfect):
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  /

```

In summary, a perfect binary tree is a subset of both full and complete binary trees, while full and complete binary trees are not subsets of each other.

No, a full binary tree does not have to be a complete binary tree. A full binary tree is one where every node has either 0 or 2 children, but it does not necessarily have to be filled from left to right at every level.

### Example of a Full Binary Tree (not complete):
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \
    4   5
```
This tree is full because every node has either 0 or 2 children, but it is not complete because the last level is not filled from left to right.

### Example of a Complete Binary Tree:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  /
    4   5 6
```
This tree is complete because all levels are fully filled except possibly the last, which is filled from left to right.

### Example of a Complete Binary Tree (not perfect):
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  /
    4   5 6
```
This tree is complete but not perfect because the last level is not fully filled.

### Tree in Question:
```
        1
       / 
      2   
     / \  
    4   5
```
This tree is **not** a complete binary tree because the last level is not filled from left to right. In a complete binary tree, all nodes at the last level must be as far left as possible.

### Summary:
- A full binary tree does not have to be a complete binary tree.
- A complete binary tree must have all levels fully filled except possibly the last, which must be filled from left to right.
- The given tree is not a complete binary tree because it does not satisfy the left-to-right filling requirement at the last level.

### Definitions:

1. **Fully Filled**:
   - This means that all possible nodes at that level are present. For example, in a binary tree, a level is fully filled if every node at that level has two children (except for the leaf nodes).

2. **Filled**:
   - This generally means that nodes are present at that level, but it does not specify whether all possible nodes are present. In the context of a complete binary tree, "filled from left to right" means that nodes are added from the leftmost position to the rightmost position without any gaps.

### Levels in a Binary Tree:
- **Level 1**: The root node of the tree. It is the topmost level.
- **Last Level**: The deepest level in the tree where nodes are present. In a complete binary tree, this level may not be fully filled, but nodes must be as far left as possible.

### Example:
Consider the following binary tree:
```
        1        <- Level 1
       / \
      2   3      <- Level 2
     / \  /
    4   5 6      <- Level 3 (Last Level)
```
- **Level 1**: Contains the root node `1`.
- **Level 2**: Contains nodes `2` and `3`.
- **Level 3 (Last Level)**: Contains nodes `4`, `5`, and `6`.

In this example:
- Levels 1 and 2 are fully filled.
- Level 3 is filled from left to right but not fully filled.

### Summary:
- **Fully Filled**: All possible nodes at that level are present.
- **Filled**: Nodes are present, but not necessarily all possible nodes.
- **Level 1**: The root level of the tree.
- **Last Level**: The deepest level with nodes in the tree.


A complete binary tree has specific requirements for all levels, not just the last level. Here are the detailed requirements:

### Requirements for a Complete Binary Tree:
1. **All levels except the last must be fully filled**:
   - This means that every node at these levels must have two children.
2. **The last level must be filled from left to right**:
   - Nodes at the last level should be as far left as possible without any gaps.

### Explanation with Examples:

#### Example of a Complete Binary Tree:
```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     / \  /
    4   5 6
```
- **Level 1**: Fully filled (node `1` has two children).
- **Level 2**: Fully filled (nodes `2` and `3` each have two children or one child).
- **Level 3 (Last Level)**: Filled from left to right (nodes `4`, `5`, and `6` are as far left as possible).

#### Example of a Non-Complete Binary Tree:
```
        1
       / 
      2   
     / \  
    4   5
```
- **Level 1**: Not fully filled (node `1` has only one child).
- **Level 2**: Not fully filled (node `2` has two children, but node `3` is missing).
- **Level 3 (Last Level)**: Nodes `4` and `5` are present, but the level is not filled from left to right because there is a gap where node `3` should be.

### Summary:
- A complete binary tree requires that all levels except the last are fully filled.
- The last level must be filled from left to right.
- The tree you provided is not a complete binary tree because it does not meet these requirements at all levels, not just the last level.
